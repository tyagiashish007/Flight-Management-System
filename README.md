# Flight-Management-System
A Flight Reservation System is a simple application, which is created with the basic idea to allow users to register themselves and book tickets. MakeMyTrip and Yatra are some examples of flight reservation systems. As part of this project, you will create a miniature version of a Flight Reservation System.
